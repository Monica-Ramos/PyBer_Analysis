# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

This project consisit on two main deliverables. The first one has the purpose of creating a DataFrame that displays ride sharing by city type. Deliverable 2 consisits in creating a multiple- line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Both deliverables aim to show how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at Pyber.


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

From deliverable 1 we can conclude that the highest number of total drivers and total rides are in cities located in an urban zone. Whereas the cities located in rural zones have the least number of total drivers and rides. The total fares per city type are highest in urban zones and smallest in rural zones. However the average fare per ride and driver is higher in rural zones than in urban and suburban zones. The next image shows the complete DataFrame where we can compare the metrics mentioned before:
